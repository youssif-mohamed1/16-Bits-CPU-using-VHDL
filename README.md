# 16-Bits-CPU-using-VHDL
MIPS CPU in VHDL
Overview
This project implements a MIPS (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages) CPU in VHDL. The CPU includes a ROM (Read-Only Memory), RAM (Random Access Memory), a register file, and a register flag. The instructions are handled using if-else constructs in a single VHDL file.

Features
MIPS Architecture: The CPU is designed based on the MIPS architecture.
Memory Components: Includes ROM for storing instructions, RAM for data storage, and a register file for register operations.
Instruction Handling: Instructions are processed using if-else constructs, providing a clear structure for code execution.
Usage
Simulation:

Open the project in your VHDL development environment.
Simulate the design to observe the CPU's behavior.
Synthesis:

Utilize synthesis tools compatible with your FPGA platform to synthesize the VHDL code.
Implementation:

Implement the synthesized design on your target FPGA platform.
File Structure
cpu_mips.vhdl: Main VHDL file containing the MIPS CPU implementation.
README.md: This file providing an overview of the project.
